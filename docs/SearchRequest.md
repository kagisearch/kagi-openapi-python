# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of SearchRequest from a JSON string
search_request_instance = SearchRequest.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(SearchRequest.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
search_request_dict = search_request_instance.to_dict()
